### Issues

Please be sure to include the minecraft version and modloader you are running on. As I am currently supporting 1.12.2, 1.16.5, 1.18.2(also fabric) and 1.19.2, I need to know which version you are running on as there are quite a few differences between the different versions currently.

### Build

1. Clone the repo
2. Build with `./gradlew build`
3. For Intellij, make sure you run `genIntellijRuns` in order to auto create the run configurations.
